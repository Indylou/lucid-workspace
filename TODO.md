# Project Cleanup Tasks

## 1. Remove Unused Files
- [x] `src/logo.svg` - Default React logo not used in current UI
- [x] `src/App.css` - Styles now in component-specific files
- [x] `src/reportWebVitals.ts` - Optional performance monitoring
- [x] `src/setupTests.ts` - Only needed if running tests
- [x] Clean up any associated imports in other files

## 2. Database Migration Cleanup
- [ ] Remove schema files and create a schema documentation instead
- [ ] Fix comments table foreign key constraint (uuid vs text issue)
- [ ] Review and ensure consistent RLS policies across migrations
- [ ] Add missing indexes for performance optimization

## 3. Type Safety Improvements
- [x] Review and fix `any` and `unknown` types in components
- [x] Align type definitions between:
  - `todo-service.ts`
  - `todo-extensions.ts`
  - `TodoItemAttributes`
  - `TodoItem` interface
- [x] Add proper type definitions for API responses
- [x] Ensure consistent null handling in type definitions

## 4. Code Organization
- [ ] Move todo-related components from root components directory to features/todos
- [ ] Organize shared components into proper categories
- [ ] Review and clean up utility functions
- [ ] Ensure consistent import paths
- [ ] Consolidate code where effective (e.g. document editor) and create a shared types directory for common interfaces

## 5. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Review and optimize React component re-renders
- [ ] Add proper loading states
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Review and optimize database queries

## 6. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Add basic unit tests on a single testing page for critical components
- [ ] Add integration tests for todo functionality
- [ ] Document component props and interfaces
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- [ ] Create README files for major features

## 7. Security & Error Handling
- [ ] Review and strengthen RLS policies
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API calls
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of user data
- [ ] Add proper logging for errors

## 8. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling across components and move away from in-line styling
- [ ] Add proper loading indicators
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add success notifications for actions
- [ ] Review and improve accessibility

## Priority Order
1. Database Migration Cleanup (to prevent data issues)
2. Type Safety Improvements (to catch potential bugs)
3. Remove Unused Files (to reduce bundle size)
4. Code Organization (to improve maintainability)
5. Security & Error Handling (to ensure robust operation)
6. Performance Optimizations
7. UI/UX Improvements
8. Testing & Documentation

## Notes
- Each task should be completed in a separate branch
- All changes should be reviewed before merging
- Update documentation as we make changes
- Test thoroughly in development before deploying
